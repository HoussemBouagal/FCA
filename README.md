# ✨ AFC JavaFX Application ✨

## 📌 Overview
The **🔍 Analysis Factorial Correspondence Application** is a JavaFX-based project designed to perform hypothesis testing using chi-square calculations. It allows users to input observed values, visualize data through a 📊 bar chart, and calculate relevant statistical metrics such as chi-square, degrees of freedom, and contingency coefficients. Results are displayed in a 📋 table and printed to the 🖥️ console for detailed analysis.

---

## 🌟 Features
- **📝 User Input**: Enter observed values via a dialog box.
- **📊 Data Visualization**: Compare observed and theoretical values in a bar chart.
- **📈 Statistical Analysis**:
  - Calculates chi-square values and degrees of freedom.
  - Evaluates the null hypothesis based on a critical chi-square value.
  - Computes the contingency coefficient.
- **📋 Tabular Display**: Shows processed data in a table.
- **🖥️ Console Output**: Prints detailed calculation results to the console.

## 🛠️ Requirements
### 💻 Software
- ☕ Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher.
- 🎭 JavaFX SDK (if not bundled with the JDK).

### 🖥️ Hardware
- ⚙️ Compatible with any standard computer capable of running Java applications.

## 🚀 Setup
### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/AFC-javafx.git
cd AFC-javafx
```

### 2️⃣ Compile the Project
Ensure you have JavaFX properly set up and included in your environment.
```bash
javac --module-path /path/to/javafx-sdk/lib --add-modules javafx.controls -d out TP/AFC.java
```

### 3️⃣ Run the Application
```bash
java --module-path /path/to/javafx-sdk/lib --add-modules javafx.controls -cp out TP.AFC
```

---

## 🎯 Usage
### ▶️ Running the Application
1️⃣ Launch the application.
2️⃣ Enter observed values separated by commas in the input dialog.
3️⃣ View the 📊 bar chart comparing observed and theoretical values.
4️⃣ Check the 🖥️ console for detailed results of the hypothesis test.
5️⃣ Review the 📋 table displaying the success rates and related details.

### 📚 Results Explanation
- **📏 Chi-Square Calculation**: Determines whether to reject the null hypothesis.
- **🔢 Degrees of Freedom**: Number of independent values in the dataset.
- **⚖️ Critical Value**: Predefined value to compare against the calculated chi-square.
- **🔗 Contingency Coefficient**: Measures the association strength.
